    <p>In October, I recently showcased my 2021 fashion collection in Minnesota with
        Fresh Traditions as a returning designer. I'm currently finishing up my first
        international collaboration with SHEIN. It's such an honor to designer through
        their SHEIN X program and platform. SHEIN is known for their E-commerce brand
        and affordable fast fashion.

        In July 2021, I graduated my first Full Stack Web and Mobile Development bootcamp
        with Nucamp. Though, I feel like they were a great starting point and I learned a lot
        but the course was still lacking student and instructor interaction. Since, it was a
        self pace but regulated course, we spent 90% of the time self-learning & 10% on Saturday
        Zoom Workshops with our instructor. After much research, I'm content with Per Scholas's
        teaching structure and curriculum. I'm ready to take my coding skills up another level.
